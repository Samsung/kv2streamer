issue01: malformed packet exception

when: more than 3-4 users are present. This is after enlarging the size of the buffer on the server, otherwise the server will crash due to buffer out of space.

where: client, error msg:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'osc::MalformedPacketException'
  what():  element size must be multiple of four
Aborted

Possible cause: buffer too large, not being received correctly by client

Possible fix:
- reduce the size of buffer per message by:
	1. use osc bundle? put each user into 1 message then bundle all of them
	2. use separate messages without bundling, possible issues with making sure all data arrive.
