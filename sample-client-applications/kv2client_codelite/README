About this Sample Application
=============================

This sample application demonstrates how to use the KV2Client API.
It retrieves data from the server and renders it on a GLFW window.

**for information on how to include KV2Client API in your application, see README in /client 
**for general information on KV2Streamer, see README at root.

This particular sample application uses glfw and gl to render the frames
retrieved from KV2Client API, which requires linking to the following libraries:
	libglfw
	libGL

and including the following header files:
	#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>
