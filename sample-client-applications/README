How To Include KV2Client API in your Application [UBUNTU] 
=========================================================

This document describes how you can use KV2Streamer client-side API. 
This document DOES NOT include instructions to build an example application that renders the data received; you're free to use any libraries/frameworks to do the rendering.

**for sample application, see the readme in client/kv2client_codelite
**for general information about kv2streamer readme at root

To use the client API of KV2Streamer, you need to include all the source files and required libraries.

1. Install boost (1.56.0): http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_56_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html
2. Install gstreamer-1.0.

3. Add the following header search paths:

boost:
	/usr/local/include/boost

gstreamer:	
	/usr/local/include/gstreamer-1.0
	/usr/include/glib-2.0
	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include

source:
	client/kv2client
	shared
	shared/oscpack_multicast/oscpack_1_1_0

4. Add the following library search paths:

	/usr/local/lib
	/usr/local/lib/gstreamer-1.0

5. Link to the following libraries:

	libboost_system
	libboost_thread
	libgstreamer-1.0
	libgstapp-1.0
	libglib-2.0
	libgmodule-2.0
	libgthread-2.0
	libgobject-2.0

6. Add all the source files (*.cpp) from the following directories:
	
	client/kv2client
	shared
	BUT EXCLUDE shared/oscpack_multicast/oscpack_1_1_0/ip/win32	

7. Include the following in your application:
	#include "KV2ClientCommon.h"

8. setting up your network
	both machines server (windows 8) and client (ubuntu) will be connected to the same switch
	on ubuntu: go to > System Settings > Network > choose the right one > Options > IPv4 Settings
	Address: 192.168.8.3
	Netmask: 255.255.255.0
	Gateway: 192.168.8.250
	in "/client/kv2client/ClientConfig.h" specify the NETWORK_INTERFACE

And you should be all set!

Sample Build Instructions: Codelite
===================================

Include the following header paths: (Common Settings > Compiler > Include Paths)
	.
	/usr/local/include/boost
	/usr/local/include/gstreamer-1.0
	/usr/include/glib-2.0
	/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include
	$(WorkspacePath)/../../shared/oscpack_multicast/oscpack_1_1_0
	$(WorkspacePath)/../../client/kv2client
	$(WorkspacePath)/../../shared

Add all the .cpp files in the following directory to your project (right click on project > Import Files from Directory):
	client/kv2client
	shared
	BUT EXCLUDE shared/oscpack_multicast/oscpack_1_1_0/ip/win32
